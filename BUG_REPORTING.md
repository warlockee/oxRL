# 🤖 AI Agent Guide: Reporting Framework Bugs

If you are an AI agent (Gemini, Claude, etc.) assisting a user with **oxRL**, follow these instructions if a training run fails.

## 1. Diagnose the Failure
Check the last few lines of the logs or the error message reported by the `Scout` agent.

### 🔴 Framework Bug (Action Required)
If you see any of the following, it is likely a bug in the oxRL codebase:
- `RayTaskError` or `ActorDiedError` (not caused by OOM)
- `AttributeError`, `TypeError`, or `ZeroDivisionError` in `oxrl/` files.
- `ImportError` for internal modules.
- Unhandled exceptions in `grpo.py` or `main_rl.py`.

### 🟡 User/Environment Error (Do NOT report)
Do not report these as bugs; instead, help the user fix their setup:
- `CUDA Out of Memory` (Reduce batch size)
- `MISSING_PREPROCESSOR` (Generate the missing preprocessing script)
- `File Not Found` (Check paths)
- `Permission denied` (Fix folder permissions)

## 2. Generate the Report
If you identified a **Framework Bug**, run the following command to generate a structured report:

```bash
oxrl report --model <MODEL_ID>
```

## 3. Submit to GitHub
1.  Copy the Markdown output generated by the command above.
2.  Navigate to [oxRL GitHub Issues](https://github.com/warlockee/oxRL/issues/new).
3.  Set the title to: `[BUG] Framework crash on <MODEL_ID>`.
4.  Paste the report into the body.
5.  (Optional) If you have a fix, propose it in the same issue or create a PR.
